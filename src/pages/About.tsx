      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to GoVan, where convenience meets community! We’re on a mission
        to make van rentals easy, affordable, and accessible to everyone—whether
        you're renting for a weekend getaway, moving across town, or sharing
        your van to earn a little extra cash.
      </p>
      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>
        At GoVan, we connect people who need a van with those who have one to
        share. Our platform allows you to either rent a van from a local owner
        or list your own van to earn extra income. No more long rental lines or
        paying for a van you don’t need. Instead, we bring flexibility, trust,
        and convenience to your doorstep.
      </p>
      <h2>For Renters</h2>
      <p>
        Need a van for a move, a road trip, or a weekend project? Find the
        perfect van nearby and book it in just a few clicks. With a range of
        options from compact cargo vans to spacious family vehicles, you’ll find
        a solution that fits your needs—and your budget. Best of all, you’ll be
        renting from someone local, so you’re supporting your community while
        driving in comfort.
      </p>
      <h2>For Owners</h2>
      <p>
        Got a van that’s sitting idle? Rent it out and start earning money with
        ease. Whether you need extra cash for your next adventure or simply want
        to put your vehicle to good use, our platform makes it simple to list
        your van and set your own terms. Plus, we provide all the support you
        need, from insurance to 24/7 roadside assistance, so you can rent with
        confidence.
